# QA Test Report: Freelancer HQ+ Web Application

## Project Overview

This repository contains a complete **Manual QA Test Report** for **Freelancer HQ+**, a freelancing platform similar to Upwork. The project was a hands-on testing engagement to evaluate the platform's core functionalities, usability, and stability before a wider release.

As the sole QA analyst on this project, I was responsible for the end-to-end testing process—from test planning and case design to execution, defect logging, and reporting—in the absence of formal requirement documents.

## Key Objectives

The primary goal was to assess the quality of key user flows through **manual exploratory testing**. The main objectives were:

- To verify the functionality and reliability of core features
- To identify defects that could impact user experience and data integrity
- To evaluate the application's usability and cross-browser consistency
- To provide actionable recommendations for improvement
